## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an **m x n** integer matrix matrix, if an element is **0** , set its entire row and column to 0. **You must do it in place.**

### Example 1:

**Input:** matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

**Output:** [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

**Explanation:**

Element at position (1,1) is 0, so set entire row 1 and column 1 to 0.

### Example 2:

**Input:** matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]

**Output:** [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

**Explanation:**

There are two zeroes: (0,0) and (0,3).

- Row 0 → all elements become 0
- Column 0 and column 3 → all elements become 0

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[0].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- -2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1
