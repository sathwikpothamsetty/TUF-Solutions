## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array **asteroids** representing asteroids in a row. **Each asteroid moves at the** **same speed.**

The **absolute value** of an asteroid represents its **size** . The sign of an asteroid represents its direction: **positive (+) means moving right, negative (-) means moving left.**

**Collision rules:**

- Asteroids moving in the same direction never collide.
- When two asteroids moving in opposite directions collide, the smaller asteroid explodes and the larger asteroid continues moving in the same direction.
- If both asteroids are equal in size, both explode.
- Collisions are resolved one at a time, from left to right. If an asteroid survives a collision, it continues moving and may collide immediately with the next asteroid in its path.

Return the **state** of the **asteroids** after all collisions as an array in the **same order.**

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** asteroids = [1, 2, 3, -4, -2]</p><p>

**Output:** [-4, -2]</p><p>

**Explanation:** </p>
- Asteroid 3 and -4 collide → 3 explodes, -4 survives.
- Asteroid -4 continues and collides with 2 → 2 explodes, -4 continues.
- Asteroid -4 collides with 1 → 1 explodes, -4 continues.
- Next asteroid -2 is moving left → no collision.

**Final state: [-4, -2].**

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** asteroids = [5, 10, -5, -10, 8, -8, -3, 12]</p><p>

**Output:** [5, 12]</p><p>

**Explanation:** </p>
- Asteroid 10 and -5 collide → -5 explodes, 10 survives.
- Asteroid 10 and -10 collide → both explode.
- Asteroid 8 and -8 collide → both explode.
- Asteroid -3 moves left → collides with 5 (right-moving) → 5 > 3 → -3 explodes, 5 survives.
- Asteroid 12 moves right → no collision with 5 because it is behind → 12 survives.

**Final state: [5, 12]**

### Constraints

·&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <= asteroids.length <= 10^5

·&nbsp;&nbsp;-10^6 <= asteroids[i] <= 10^6

·&nbsp;&nbsp;asteroids[i] != 0
