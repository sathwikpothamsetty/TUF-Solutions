## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a root of binary tree, find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes (p, q) in the tree.

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

**Note** : Return the TreeNode itself, not its value.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** root = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4] , p = 5, q = 1</p><p>

**Output:** 3</p><p>

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** root = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4] , p = 5, q = 4</p><p>

**Output:** 5</p><p>

### Constraints

- 2 <= Number of Nodes <= 10^5
- -10^6 <= node.val <= 10^6
- All values in tree are **unique.**
