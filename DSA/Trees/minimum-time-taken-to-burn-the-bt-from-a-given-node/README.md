## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a target node data and a root of binary tree. If the target is set on fire, determine the shortest amount of **time** needed to **burn** the entire binary tree.

It is known that in 1 second all nodes connected to a given node get burned. That is its left child, right child, and parent.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** root = [1, 2, 3, 4, null, 5, 6, null, 7]. target = 1</p><p>

**Output:** 3</p><p>

**Explanation:** The node with value 1 is set on fire.</p>In 1st second it burns node 2 and node 3.

In 2nd second it burns nodes 4, 5, 6.

In 3rd second it burns node 7.

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5, null, 4], target = 4</p><p>

**Output:** 4</p><p>

**Explanation:** The node with value 4 is set on fire.</p>In 1st second it burns node 3.

In 2nd second it burns node 1.

In 3rd second it burns node 2.

In 4th second it burns node 5.

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of Nodes <= 10^4
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- All Node.val values are **unique** .
- target will always be present in tree
